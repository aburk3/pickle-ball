    → This website's purpose is to bring communication closer to the forefront of Pickleball and serve as a resource to players, tournament directors, and others.
    This website is a variety of things, amongst which are:
    <ul>
      <li>Tournament Directors can gauge interest in a particular tournament, venue, or event/setup by creating a tournament page.
      <b>NOTE: there is no functionality to sign-up/register for a tournament - this is purely to raise awareness, voice concerns, and to provide updates and feedback on tournaments.</b></li>
      <li>Tournament Directors can list the price, events, sanctioning status or other information they would like players to know
      about <i>prior</i> to ever creating the tournament elsewhere. Players may then provide feedback, suggestions, and more regarding
      the proposed tournament set-up, allowing a tournament director to adjust as necessary for demand/interest.</li>
      <li>Players can create Posts in a centralized location about Pickleball related topics (equipment, tournaments, etc.).</li>
      <li>Players can create clubs and provide updates to members within those clubs.</li>
      <li>The club admin can post meeting dates/times within a club.</li>
      <li>The club admin can transfer admin status to another player within a club</li>
      <li>Players can search for: other players, tournaments, and clubs by name, state, or city.</li>
      <li>Players can search for tournaments and clubs within their city by clicking Tournaments/Clubs '...Near Me' in the menu drop-down</li>
    </ul>
